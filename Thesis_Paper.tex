	\end{center}

	This project employed machine learning concepts and processes in an attempt to teach a computer an algorithm that outputs a cookie recipe that is comparable to human-made recipes.The process involved feeding the algorithms a data set of cookie recipes that included details such as ingredients, ratings, and calories. A second algorithm was used to construct instructions for a recipe once ingredients were selected based off of instructions from the dataset of recipes.The recipes were gathered by scraping the website allrecipes.com for chocolate chip cookie recipes that were compiled in order to “teach” the computer to recognize tasty cookies by looking at things such as reviews, ingredients, and calories.

		\section{ Introduction: Making a Highly Rate Chocolate Chip Cookie}
		 The objective of these experiments was to generate a cookie recipe that was optimized for critic ratings by using multiple types of neural and non-neural networks to predict and create chocolate chip cookie recipes based on the input of over 250 human-made recipes and instructions. There were 138 different parameters inputted, including Rating, Calories, and 136 different ingredients such as sugar, flour, and egg.
		 \newline\newline
		 To get the instructions, we created a vector-to-sequence algorithm that takes the input of a recipe ingredient vector and uses the instructions from the 250 man-made recipes to make predictions about the sequence of instructions in the output.
		\subsection*{Related Work}
		The use of machine learning for baking/cooking is relatively unexplored, but there are some articles, such as \textit{Bayesian Optimization for a Better Dessert}\footnote{Kochanski, Greg et al. “Bayesian Optimization for a Better Dessert.” (2017).} and \textit{Cuisine Classification and Recipe Generation}\footnote{Naik, JitendraB.. “Cuisine Classification and Recipe Generation.” (2015).}.When conducting exploratory research, we were unable to find another study that employed vector-to-sequence algorithms. 
		
		\section{Methods and Experiments}
		\subsection{Algorithms}
		This experiment involved testing 9 different algorithms: Deep Learning Neural Networks, Gradient Boosting, Extreme Trees, Random Forest, Normalized Neural Networks, Wide Neural Networks, Neural Networks SVM, and Linear Regression. Based on the resulting vectors from each, we narrowed our focus to the following three algorithms: Deep Learning, Gradient Boosting, and Extreme Trees.

		\subsection{Surveys}
		Survey questions included:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Appearance  on a scale of 1 (unfit for consumpution) to 5 (Excellent) 
			\item Aroma on a scale of 1 (unfit for consumpution) to 5 (Excellent) 
			\item Taste on a scale of 1 (unfit for consumpution) to 5 (Excellent) 
			\item Texture:
			\begin{multicols}{2}
				\begin{itemize}
					\item Crunchy
					\item Chewy
					\item Gooey
					\item Juicy
					\item Soggy
					\item Creamy
					\item Other
				\end{itemize}
			\end{multicols}
		\item Overall Sastification on a scale of 1 (Hated It) to 10 (Loved It)
				
		\end{itemize}
		\section{Analysis}	
		\subsection{Ingredients}
		\subsection{Instructions}
		As the vector-to-sequence algorithm is previously untested in other research, the end results leave something to desire in terms of ability to finesse and actual usability. However, it is an accomplishment to have gotten a working algorithm that takes in an ingredient vector and outputs a semi-usable recipe. Improvements include ensuring that the instructions contain all ingredients in the vector that contain non-zero values and eliminating repeating loops that the algorithm gets stuck on.
